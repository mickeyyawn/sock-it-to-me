=============

Just a short example of using socket.io

## How to use?

$ node server.js

This will start the app listening on port 9999.  Open two browser windows.  Navigate first one to http://localhost:9999, navigate the second one to http://localhost:9999/productListing.

In the first window, type in a new product name and click 'add product'.  In the second window you will see your new product listing!  

Exciting huh?
